    "## Object-Oriented Programming in Python: Defining Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "We stated earlier that Python is an object-oriented programming language. So far, we have used a number of built-in classes to show examples of data and control structures. One of the most powerful features in an object-oriented programming language is the ability to allow a programmer (problem solver) to create new classes that model data that is needed to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we use abstract data types to provide the logical description of what a data object looks like (its state) and what it can do (its methods). By building a class that implements an abstract data type, a programmer can take advantage of the abstraction process and at the same time provide the details necessary to actually use the abstraction in a program. Whenever we want to implement an abstract data type, we will do so with a new class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A `Fraction` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common example to show the details of implementing a user-defined class is to construct a class to implement the abstract data type `Fraction`. We have already seen that Python provides a number of numeric classes for our use. There are times, however, that it would be most appropriate to be able to create data objects that “look like” fractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fraction such as $\\frac{3}{5}$ consists of two parts. The top value, known as the numerator, can be any integer. The bottom value, called the denominator, can be any integer greater than 0 (negative fractions have a negative numerator). Although it is possible to create a floating point approximation for any fraction, in this case we would like to represent the fraction as an exact value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operations for the `Fraction` type will allow a `Fraction` data object to behave like any other numeric value. We need to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions. We also want to be able to show fractions using the standard “slash” form, for example 3/5. In addition, all fraction methods should return results in their lowest terms so that no matter what computation is performed, we always end up with the most common form.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we define a new class by providing a name and a set of method definitions that are syntactically similar to function definitions. For this example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Fraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "   #the methods go here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "provides the framework for us to define the methods. The first method that all classes should provide is the constructor. The constructor defines the way in which data objects are created. To create a Fraction object, we will need to provide two pieces of data, the numerator and the denominator. In Python, the constructor method is always called __init__ (two underscores before and after init) and is shown in Listing below."

It must always be the first formal parameter; however, it will never be given an actual parameter value upon invocation. As described earlier, fractions require two pieces of state data, the numerator and the denominator. The notation `self.num` in the constructor defines the `fraction` object to have an internal data object called `num` as part of its state. Likewise, `self.den` creates the denominator. The values of the two formal parameters are initially assigned to the state, allowing the new `fraction` object to know its starting value.\n",

    "## Inheritance: Logic Gates and Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "This final section will introduce another important aspect of object-oriented programming. **Inheritance** is the ability for one class to be related to another class in much the same way that people can be related to one another. Children inherit characteristics from their parents. Similarly, Python child classes can inherit characteristic data and behavior from a parent class. These classes are often referred to as **subclasses** and **superclasses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next Figure shows the built-in Python collections and their relationships to one another. We call a relationship structure such as this an **inheritance hierarchy**. For example, the list is a child of the sequential collection. In this case, we call the list the child and the sequence the parent (or subclass list and superclass sequence). This is often referred to as an `IS-A Relationship` (the list **IS-A** sequential collection). This implies that lists inherit important characteristics from sequences, namely the ordering of the underlying data and operations such as concatenation, repetition, and indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/in.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists, tuples, and strings are all types of sequential collections. They all inherit common data organization and operations. However, each of them is distinct based on whether the data is homogeneous and whether the collection is immutable. The children all gain from their parents but distinguish themselves by adding additional characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By organizing classes in this hierarchical fashion, object-oriented programming languages allow previously written code to be extended to meet the needs of a new situation. In addition, by organizing data in this hierarchical manner, we can better understand the relationships that exist. We can be more efficient in building our abstract representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this idea further, we will construct a **simulation**, an application to simulate digital circuits. The basic building block for this simulation will be the logic gate. These electronic switches represent boolean algebra relationships between their input and their output. In general, gates have a single output line. The value of the output is dependent on the values given on the input lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "AND gates have two input lines, each of which can be either 0 or 1 (representing `False` or `True`, repectively). If both of the input lines have the value 1, the resulting output is 1. However, if either or both of the input lines is 0, the result is 0. OR gates also have two input lines and produce a 1 if one or both of the input values is a 1. In the case where both input lines are 0, the result is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOT gates differ from the other two gates in that they only have a single input line. The output value is simply the opposite of the input value. If 0 appears on the input, 1 is produced on the output. Similarly, 1 produces 0. The next Figure shows how each of these gates is typically represented. Each gate also has a truth table of values showing the input-to-output mapping that is performed by the gate.\n",

    "By combining these gates in various patterns and then applying a set of input values, we can build circuits that have logical functions. The next Figure shows a circuit consisting of two AND gates, one OR gate, and a single NOT gate. The output lines from the two AND gates feed directly into the OR gate, and the resulting output from the OR gate is given to the NOT gate. If we apply a set of input values to the four input lines (two for each AND gate), the values are processed and a result appears at the output of the NOT gate. The Figure also shows an example with values.\n",

At the top of the hierarchy, the `LogicGate` class represents the most general characteristics of logic gates: namely, a label for the gate and an output line. The next level of subclasses breaks the logic gates into two families, those that have one input line and those that have two. Below that, the specific logic functions of each appear.\n",

    "The other behavior that every logic gate needs is the ability to know its output value. This will require that the gate perform the appropriate logic based on the current input. In order to produce output, the gate needs to know specifically what that logic is. This means calling a method to perform the logic computation. The complete class is shown in below."

Those details will be included by each individual gate that is added to the hierarchy. This is a very powerful idea in object-oriented programming. We are writing a method that will use code that does not exist yet. The parameter `self` is a reference to the actual gate object invoking the method. Any new logic gate that gets added to the hierarchy will simply need to implement the `performGateLogic` function and it will be used at the appropriate time. Once done, the gate can provide its output value. This ability to extend a hierarchy that currently exists and provide the specific functions that the hierarchy needs to use the new class is extremely important for reusing existing code.\n",

    "The code above implement these two classes. The constructors in both of these classes start with an explicit call to the constructor of the parent class using the parent’s `__init__` method. When creating an instance of the `BinaryGate` class, we first want to initialize any data items that are inherited from `LogicGate`. In this case, that means the label for the gate. The constructor then goes on to add the two input lines (`pinA` and `pinB`). This is a very common pattern that you should always use when building class hierarchies. Child class constructors need to call parent class constructors and then move on to their own distinguishing data.\n",

This is a more general mechanism, and is widely used, especially when a class has more than one parent. But, this is not something we are going to discuss in this introduction. For example in our example above `LogicGate.__init__(self,n)` could be replaced with `super(UnaryGate,self).__init__(n)`.\n",
